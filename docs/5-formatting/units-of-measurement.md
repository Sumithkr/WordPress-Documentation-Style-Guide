## Currency

Mention to the reader distinctly what country's currency that you're referring to. For example, the dollar sign ($) can be mistaken for US dollars, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, and multiple other currencies. Use [ISO defined country or region codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#Active_codes) to depict international currencies, if possible.

See [Currency in Numbers]() for additional information.
