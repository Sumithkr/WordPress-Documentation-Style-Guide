# Numbers

Spell out whole numbers from zero through nine.

## Numbers as words

## Ordinal numbers

Write all ordinal numbers as fully-spelled words.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 18th, 99th [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: First, second, third, seventh, eighteenth, ninety-ninth [/tip]  

## Numbers as Roman numerals

Avoid using Roman numerals. Instead use standard Arabic numerals in your documentation.

You can use Roman numerals to denote "steps or sub-steps in procedures."

## Fractions

Express fractions as decimal numbers, whenever possible. Don't use slashes with fractions, as they may be difficult to comprehend. Using slashes with fractions could be misunderstood as alternatives or combinations. When expressing fractions as words, use a hyphen to link the numerator with the denominator, unless one of them is already hyphenated.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: 3/4 [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: ¾ [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: 0.75 [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: 75% [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: three-fourths [/tip]  

[warning] Not Recommended: 4 1/2 [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: 4½ [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: 4.5 [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: four one-halves [/tip]  

## Percentages

Denote percentages with the numeral and a percent sign (%) after it, without a space between them.  
**Exception:** If the percentage starts the sentence, then spell out both the number and the word percent.
