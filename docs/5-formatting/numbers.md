# Numbers

## Numbers as words

- Spell out whole numbers from zero through nine, with exceptions as described in [Numbers as numerals]().
- Use the spelled-out number when it starts a sentence.   
  **Examples**  
  [tip] Recommended: Twenty files were copied. [/tip]  

  You can rewrite the sentence so that the number doesn't start the sentence.  
  **Examples**  
  [warning] Not Recommended: 1500 records were cleared from the old directories. [/warning]  
  [tip] Recommended: Freeing up some space in the old directories, almost 1500 records were cleared. [/tip]  
- When a number is followed by another numeral, use a numeral for one and spell out the other.

## Numbers as numerals

## Ordinal numbers

Write all ordinal numbers as fully-spelled words.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 18th, 99th [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: First, second, third, seventh, eighteenth, ninety-ninth [/tip]  

## Numbers as Roman numerals

Avoid using Roman numerals. Instead use standard Arabic numerals in your documentation.

You can use Roman numerals to denote "steps or sub-steps in procedures."

## Commas and decimal points in numbers

## Fractions

Express fractions as decimal numbers, whenever possible. Don't use slashes with fractions, as they may be difficult to comprehend. Using slashes with fractions could be misunderstood as alternatives or combinations. When expressing fractions as words, use a hyphen to link the numerator with the denominator, unless one of them is already hyphenated.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: 3/4 [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: ¾ [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: 0.75 [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: 75% [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: three-fourths [/tip]  

[warning] Not Recommended: 4 1/2 [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: 4½ [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: 4.5 [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: four one-halves [/tip]  

## Percentages

Denote percentages with the numeral and a percent sign (%) after it, without a space between them.  
**Exception:** If the percentage starts the sentence, then spell out both the number and the word *percent*.

**Examples**  

[tip] Recommended: 99 percent completed. [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: The progress bar is at 99%. [/tip]  

## Currency

Mention to the reader distinctly what country's currency that you're referring to. For example, the dollar sign ($) can be mistaken for US dollars, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, and multiple other currencies. Use [ISO defined country or region codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#Active_codes) to depict international currencies, if possible.

When you're referencing specific amounts of money, use the currency code, followed by the amount, with no space.

**Examples**  

[tip] Recommended: The non-profit organization was endowed with a USD1.5 million grant.  [/tip]  

Capitalize the country or region, but lowercase the name of currencies.

**Examples**  

- US dollar
- Indian rupee
- Japanese yen

For US dollars, use the dollar sign at the beginning ($) of the currency. Use a comma to delineate the thousands place of whole currency; that is, use a comma in amounts that have four or more digits. Use a period to delineate whole currency and fractions of currency. Don't use any punctuation or spaces to the right of the decimal.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: You have $15.39,512 in usable credits. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: You have $15.39512 in usable credits. [/tip]  

[tip] Recommended: Monthly hosting plans start from $3.95 per website. [/tip]  

[warning] Not Recommended: The total cost may exceed $17000. [/warning]  
[warning] Not Recommended: The total cost may exceed $17 000. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: The total cost may exceed $17,000. [/tip]  

If it's clear which currency you're referring to, it's acceptable to only use the symbol rather than the word or country code itself.

## Range of numbers

[En dashes]() are generally used to indicate a range of numbers, the minus sign, or negative numbers. Although you can use en dashes for these purposes, you can also use hyphens or the word *to* for numerical ranges.

Use an en dash indicate a range of numbers such as values or dates. Don't add spaces before and after the en dash or the hyphen.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: The program was under active development from 2012 – 2017.  [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: The program was under active development from 2012–2017. [/tip]
[tip] Recommended: Select a range from 10–60 px as the width of the button. [/tip]

For additional information, see [En dashes](), [Hyphens](), and [Units of Measurement]().

## Suspended hyphens

Use [suspended hyphens]() for two or more suspended compound modifiers that start with numbers.

**Examples**  

[tip] Recommended: You can choose from either a five-, six-, or seven-sided polygon. [/tip]
