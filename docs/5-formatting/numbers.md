## Numbers as words

## Numbers as numerals

## Ordinal numbers

Write all ordinal numbers as fully-spelled words.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 18th, 99th [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: First, second, third, seventh, eighteenth, ninety-ninth [/tip]  

## Numbers as Roman numerals

Avoid using Roman numerals. Instead use standard Arabic numerals in your documentation.

You can use Roman numerals to denote "steps or sub-steps in procedures."

## Fractions

Express fractions as decimal numbers, whenever possible. Don't use slashes with fractions, as they may be difficult to comprehend. Using slashes with fractions could be misunderstood as alternatives or combinations. When expressing fractions as words, use a hyphen to link the numerator with the denominator, unless one of them is already hyphenated.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: 3/4 [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: ¾ [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: 0.75 [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: 75% [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: three-fourths [/tip]  

[warning] Not Recommended: 4 1/2 [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: 4½ [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: 4.5 [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: four one-halves [/tip]  

## Percentages

Denote percentages with the numeral and a percent sign (%) after it, without a space between them.  
**Exception:** If the percentage starts the sentence, then spell out both the number and the word *percent*.

**Examples**  

[tip] Recommended: 99 percent completed. [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: The progress bar is at 99%. [/tip]  

## Currency

Mention to the reader distinctly what country's currency that you're referring to. Use [ISO stated country codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#Active_codes) to depict international currencies, if possible.

For example, the dollar sign ($) can be mistaken for US dollars, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, and multiple other currencies.



For US dollars, use a comma to delineate the thousands place of whole currency; that is, use a comma in amounts that have four or more digits.

## Range of numbers

"En dashes" are generally used to indicate a range of numbers, the minus sign, or negative numbers. Although you can use en dashes for these purposes, you can also use hyphens or the word *to* for numerical ranges.

Use an en dash indicate a range of numbers such as values or dates. Don't add spaces before and after the en dash or the hyphen.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: The program was under active development from 2012 – 2017.  [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: The program was under active development from 2012–2017. [/tip]
[tip] Recommended: Select a range from 10–60 px as the width of the button. [/tip]

For additional information, see [En dashes](), [Hyphens](), and [Units of Measurement]().

## Suspended hyphens

Use [suspended hyphens]() for two or more suspended compound modifiers that start with numbers.

**Examples**  

[tip] Recommended: You can choose from either a five-, six-, or seven-sided polygon. [/tip]
