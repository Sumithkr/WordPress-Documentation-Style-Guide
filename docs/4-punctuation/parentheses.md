# Parentheses

Use parentheses unless absolutely required. Readers tend to overlook content inside parentheses, so avoid putting important information in them. Consider rephrasing your sentences for lesser important information as well. You can use "em dashes", "commas", "semicolons", or "periods" to provide emphasis for parenthetical phrases.
