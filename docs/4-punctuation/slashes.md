# Slashes

In general, try to avoid slashes in your documentation, except in code examples, file paths, and URLs.

## Slashes with alternatives

## Slashes with combinations

## Slashes with URLs

Use slashes in URLs, local, and internet addresses. Use two slashes after the protocol name.

**Examples**

[tip] Recommended: Visit https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/ for additional information.[/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: The uploaded file can be found on ftp://example.com/uploads. [/tip]  

## Slashes with file paths and names

Use forward slashes in computer, server, folder, and file names and paths. For Microsoft Windows file paths and names, use backslashes.

**Examples**

[tip] Recommended: Download the zip file, and extract it into the web directory for your WAMP (Windows) installation: `C:\wamp\www`. [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: Open the WordPress configuration file: `/var/www/wordpress/wp-config.php`. [/tip]

## Slashes with fractions and mathematical equations

Don't use slashes with fractions, as they may be difficult to comprehend. They could be misunderstood as alternatives or combinations.

**Examples**
