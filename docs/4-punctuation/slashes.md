# Slashes

In general, try to avoid slashes in your documentation, except in code examples, file paths, and URLs.

## Slashes with alternatives

## Slashes with combinations

Use a slash to indicate a combination. Capitalize the second word if the first word in the combination is capitalized.

## Slashes with URLs

Use slashes in URLs, local, and internet addresses. Use two slashes after the protocol name.

**Examples**

[tip] Recommended: Navigate to http://localhost/wordpress to start the WordPress install. [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: Visit https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/ for additional information.[/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: The uploaded file can be found on ftp://example.com/uploads. [/tip]  

## Slashes with file paths and names

Use forward slashes in computer, server, folder, and file names and paths. For Microsoft Windows file paths and names, use backslashes.

**Examples**

[tip] Recommended: Download the zip file, and extract it into the web directory for your WAMP (Windows) installation: `C:\wamp\www`. [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: Open the WordPress configuration file: `/var/www/wordpress/wp-config.php`. [/tip]

## Slashes with fractions and mathematical equations

Don't use slashes with fractions, as they may be difficult to comprehend. Using slashes with fractions could be misunderstood as alternatives or combinations.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: 3/4 [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: Â¾ [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: 0.75 [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: 75% [/tip]  

Be cautious while using slashes between the numerator and denominator in mathematical equations.  

**Examples**  

[tip] Sometimes okay: x/2 = 4 [/tip]  
[tip] Sometimes okay: (x+2)/8 = 2/3 [/tip]  

## Slashes with abbreviations

Don't use abbreviations utilizing slashes. Instead, spell the abbreviation out.  

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: *b/c, w/o, w/, c/o, a/c* [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: because, without, with, care of, account [/tip]  

## Slashes with dates

Don't use date formats with slashes.

See "Dates and Times" for additional information.
