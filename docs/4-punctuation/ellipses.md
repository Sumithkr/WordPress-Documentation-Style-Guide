# Ellipses

<!--Key point: In general, avoid using ellipses. -->

An *ellipsis* (plural: *ellipses*) is a set of three contiguous dots that are used to indicate omission of part of a sentence, phrase, paragraph, or content. For documentation purposes use three periods as the dots in an ellipse, unless you use an ellipsis character. An ellipsis is also used in informal writing to connote a subsiding, hesitating, or fading expression. The word ellipsis originates from the Greek word meaning "omission".

## Using ellipses

### Punctuation and spacing

Use three contiguous periods in a row while writing an ellipsis. Avoid using the ellipsis character and make use of periods in general. Insert one space before and after the ellipsis unless a punctuation mark immediately follows the ellipsis; in this case, don't insert a space after the ellipsis.

**Examples**

[warning] Not Recommended: You need to wait for the post to save...and then publish the post. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: You need to wait for the post to save ... and then publish the post. [/tip]

### In text

Don't use ellipses in your documentation. If you have to use ellipses in your documentation, rewrite your content excluding all unnecessary information while including the necessary information.  Using ellipses in quoted text is acceptable, unless they appear at the beginning or the end of the text.

**Examples**

[warning] Not Recommended: The WordPress Documentation handbook states "The Codex is a community-created repository for WordPress ...." [/warning]  
[warning] Not Recommended: The WordPress Documentation handbook states: " ... and only a WordPress.org user account is required to create a page." [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: The WordPress Documentation handbook states "The Codex is a community-created repository for WordPress, ... And only a WordPress.org user account is required to create a page." [/tip]

#### Ending a sentence with an ellipsis


### In a user interface

Only use ellipses in user interfaces if it is absolutely needed to indicate a pause in conversational UI messages. For example, the text in a UI message might read "*Searching the database ...*".
When UI elements have text with ellipses in them, exclude them from the documentation describing that UI element, unless it could cause confusion. For example, if the text in the user interface reads "*Publish ...*", document the text as "click **Publish**".

## Suspension points

When ellipses are used to connote hesitation, a pause, or an unfinished thought, they are known as suspension points. Generally, suspension points indicate an informal, spoken language tone.  Avoid using suspension points in your documentation.

**Example**
