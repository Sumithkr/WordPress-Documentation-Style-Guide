# Ellipses

An *ellipsis* (plural: *ellipses*) is a set of three contiguous dots that are used to indicate omission of part of a sentence, phrase, paragraph, or content. For documentation purposes use three periods as the dots in an ellipse, unless you use an ellipsis character. An ellipsis is also used in informal writing to connote a subsiding, hesitating, or fading expression. The word ellipsis originates from the Greek word meaning "omission".

## Suspension points

When ellipses are used to connote hesitation, a pause, or an unfinished thought, they are known as suspension points. Generally, suspension points indicate an informal, spoken language tone.  Avoid using suspension points in your documentation.

## Using ellipses

### Punctuation and spacing

Use three contiguous periods in a row while writing an ellipsis. Avoid using the ellipsis character and make use of periods in general. Insert one space before and after the ellipsis unless a punctuation mark immediately follows the ellipsis; in this case, don't insert a space after the ellipsis.
