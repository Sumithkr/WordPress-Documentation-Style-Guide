# Hyphens

## Predicate adjectives

Don't hyphenate a predicate adjective unless specifically mentioned in the "A-Z word list/glossary" or otherwise. An adjective predicate is an adjective that modifies the subject of the sentence. The adjective and the subject are connected by a linking verb.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: The image needs to be high-resolution. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: The image needs to be high resolution. [/tip]

[warning] Not Recommended: The document is up-to-date. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: The document is up to date. [/tip]

## Compound modifiers

Use hyphenated compound modifiers before a noun. A compound modifier (also known as a noun modifier) precede and modify the noun as a unit. Don't hyphenate a compound modifier when you use it after a noun.
