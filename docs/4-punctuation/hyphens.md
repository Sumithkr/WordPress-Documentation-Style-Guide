# Hyphens

## Predicate adjectives

Don't hyphenate a predicate adjective unless specifically mentioned in the "A-Z word list/glossary" or otherwise. An adjective predicate is an adjective that modifies the subject of the sentence. The adjective and the subject are connected by a linking verb.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: The image needs to be high-resolution. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: The image needs to be high resolution. [/tip]

[warning] Not Recommended: The document is up-to-date. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: The document is up to date. [/tip]

## Compound modifiers

Use hyphenated compound modifiers before a noun. A compound modifier (also known as a noun modifier) precede and modify the noun as a unit. Only hyphenate two or more words that precede and modify the noun as a unit of it doesn't result in undue confusion. Don't hyphenate a compound modifier when you use it after a noun.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: Don't use the recently deprecated tool. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: Don't use the recently-deprecated tool. [/tip]

[warning] Not Recommended: The high capacity website hosting is impressive. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: The high-capacity website hosting is impressive. [/tip]

Hyphenate two or more words that precede and modify the noun:
- If one of the words is a past or present participle (a verb ending in *-ing* or *-ed* being used as an adjective or noun).  
 **Examples**  

 - well-formatted text
 - mind-stimulating blog
 - left-aligned paragraph  


- If the compound modifier is a number or a single letter with a noun or participle.  
 **Examples**  

 - three-pronged approach
 - Cartesian x-axis
 - 4-sided quadrilateral

In compound words that precede and modify a noun as a unit, don't hyphenate:
- The word *very* when it precedes another modifier.  
 **Examples**  

 - very high capacity  
 - very fast storage


- Adverbs ending in *-ly* when they precede another modifier. Don't hyphenate adverbs unless absolutely needed for clarity. If you're doubtful of a particular word being an adverb, first refer the "Word List"; if it's not covered there, refer [The American Heritage Dictionary](https://ahdictionary.com/) and [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/).   

 **Examples**  

 - highly intensive processing
 - readily available source code

## Compound words

## Numbers and fractions

En dashes are generally used to indicate a range of numbers, the minus sign, or negative numbers. Although you can use en dashes for these purposes, you can also use hyphens or the word *to* for numerical ranges.

Use an en dash indicate a range of numbers such as values or dates. Don't add spaces before and after the en dash or the hyphen.

For more information, see "En dashes" and "Units of Measurement".

## Space around hyphens

Don't insert a space on either side of a hyphen, except when using a suspended hyphen, in which case insert a space after (but not before) the hyphen.

## Suspended hyphens

Don't use suspended compound modifiers that have a common base. You can either spell out the entire phrase, or leave a space after hyphen and leave out the base. Donâ€™t form suspended compound modifiers from one-word adjectives.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: You can use either left, right, or center-aligned text formatting. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: You can use either left-aligned, right-aligned, or center-aligned text formatting. [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: You can use either left-, right-, or center-aligned text formatting. [/tip]
