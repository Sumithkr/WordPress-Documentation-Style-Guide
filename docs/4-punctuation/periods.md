# Periods

End all independent sentences with a period, and insert one space after the period.

## Periods with parentheses

If the last part of a sentence ends within parentheses, insert the period after the closing parenthesis. If a complete, independent sentence is enclosed within parentheses, include the period inside the parentheses.
