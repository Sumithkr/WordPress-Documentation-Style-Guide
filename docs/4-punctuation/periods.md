# Periods

End all independent sentences with a period, and insert one space after the period.

## Periods with parentheses

If the last part of a sentence ends within parentheses, insert the period after the closing parenthesis. If a complete, independent sentence is enclosed within parentheses, include the period inside the parentheses.

## Periods with quotation marks

If a sentence or phrase ends with content inside quotation marks, insert the period inside the quotation marks, even if it doesn't belong in the quoted text. If the sentence or phrase inside the quotation marks ends with punctuation other than periods, such as a question mark or exclamation point, then don't use a period.

## Periods with abbreviations

Use periods at the end of shortened words. Don't use periods with acronyms and initialisms. Similarly, don't use periods with commons words that are abbreviations such as *app* or *demo*.
