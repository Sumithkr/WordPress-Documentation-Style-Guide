# Periods

End all independent sentences with a period, and insert one space after the period.

## Periods with lists

Ending a list item with a period depends on several factors including the kind of list the item appears in.

For more information about lists, see "Lists".

### Description lists

Don't insert a period at the end of a term, and insert a period at the end of a description.

## Periods with URLs

## Periods with parentheses

If the last part of a sentence ends within parentheses, insert the period after the closing parenthesis. If a complete, independent sentence is enclosed within parentheses, include the period inside the parentheses.

**Examples**

## Periods with quotation marks

If a sentence or phrase ends with content inside quotation marks, place the period inside the quotation marks, even if it doesn't belong in the quoted content. If the sentence or phrase inside the quotation marks ends with punctuation other than periods, such as a question mark or exclamation point, don't use a period.

**Examples**  

[tip] Recommended: The developer said, "This API is the newest version." [/tip]
