# Dashes

## Em dashes

Use an em dash (—) also known as a long dash, to set off a break in the flow of a sentence. Em dashes are also used to provide emphasis for parenthetical phrases more than parentheses themselves. Don't add spaces before and after the em dash.

Use one em dash on each side of the phrase that is to be embedded.
