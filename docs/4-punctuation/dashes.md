# Dashes

## Em dashes

Use an em dash (—) also known as a long dash, to set off a break in the flow of a sentence. Em dashes are also used to provide emphasis for parenthetical phrases more than parentheses themselves. Don't add spaces before and after the em dash. Don’t capitalize the first word after an em dash unless the word is a proper noun.

Use one em dash on each side of the phrase that is to be embedded.

You can also use one em dash to initiate a phrase at the end of a sentence.

Don't use an em dash as a bullet in a list. See "Lists" for additional information. Avoid using an em dash to indicate empty or unoccupied elements such as text fields, cells, and other values.

### Typing em dashes

**HTML**  
``&mdash;``  

**macOS**  
Press <kbd>Option+Shift+hyphen</kbd>.  

**Linux desktop environment**  
Enable the Compose key. (Instructions for doing that vary depending on your flavor of Linux; for examples, see Linux Keyboard Shortcuts For Text Symbols.) After the Compose key is enabled, you can create an em dash by typing the Compose key followed by three hyphens.  
Alternatively, press <kbd>Control+Shift+u</kbd>, then let go of those keys, then type <kbd>2014</kbd>, then press <kbd>Return</kbd>.  
Note: These Linux options don't work if you're signed in to the Linux command line from a remote system using ssh or the like; you have to be in a Linux desktop environment.  

**Windows**  
Turn num lock on, then hold down the left <kbd>Alt</kbd> key and type <kbd>0151</kbd> on the numeric keypad.  

Don't use an en dash (the shorter dash) or a hyphen in place of an em dash. The use of an en dash with spaces around it in place of an em dash is gradually becoming more common, but it's still not very widespread in the US in professional publishing; so far (as of early 2016), it's mostly used in Canada and a couple of other places. For now, just use the em dash.

## En dashes

En dashes are generally used to indicate a range of numbers, the minus sign, or negative numbers. Although you can use en dashes for these purposes, you can also use hyphens or the word *to* for numerical ranges.

Use an en dash indicate a range of numbers such as values or dates. Don't add spaces before and after the en dash.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: The program was under active development from 2012 – 2017.  [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: The program was under active development from 2012–2017. [/tip]
[tip] Recommended: Select a range from 10–60 px as the width of the button. [/tip]

Use an en dash to indicate negative numbers and the minus sign. While writing an equation with a minus sign, insert spaces before and after the minus (en dash). Contrarily, while writing a negative sign (en dash), don't insert a space after it but do insert one before the sign.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: Enter the CAPTCHA: 20–6=14.  [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: Enter the CAPTCHA: 20 – 6 = 14. [/tip]

[warning] Not Recommended: The value of the variable must be– 3.  [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: The value of the variable must be –3. [/tip]

For additional information, see "Range of numbers".

Don't use an en dash as a bullet in a list. See "Lists" for additional information. Avoid using an em dash to indicate empty or unoccupied elements such as text fields, cells, and other values.

Don't use an en dash to indicate a range of times. Use the word *to* instead of the en dash.

**Examples**
